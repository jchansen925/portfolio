1. In the title bar, you can give your pull request a name. 
    In the text area below the title, you can add a description of what is in the pull request. Note that a title is required and you cannot click on the **Create a pull request** button without giving your pull request a title.

1. Next, open your new pull request by clicking on the green **Create a pull request** button.

1. Clicking on **Create a pull request** button takes you to a pull request overview page. On the pull request overview page, you can view the status of your pull request. In most cases, at least one designated person must review your pull request before it can be merged. The pull request can be accepted and merged into the main branch by the reviewer or rejected. The reason given will be shown on the results page if the pull request is rejected. Go ahead and make the requested changes, then resubmit your pull request.
